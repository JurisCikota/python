# Hangman game
Hangman will import the dictionary file & select a random word from it. Then it will show you the word & your tries left, and ask you to input a letter.
When the game begins, all that is known of the mystery word is the number of letters. A guess involves suggesting a letter. When a guess is correct all occurrences of the suggested letter are revealed
